Highly recommended."\n\n', '!Hero\n\n!HERO is a 2003 Christian rock opera about Jesus. It is based on the question, "What if Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?". After the original tour in2003 ended, it was released on DVD, CD, and was written into a trilogy of novels and series of comic books.\n\n"!HERO" is a rock opera modernizing Jesus\'s last two years of life, as described in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City, in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations (ICON). Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N., nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out, except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently, New York City is a police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small, isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions, only Judaism survives and flourishes, at least, as much as it can.\n\nIn Bethlehem, PA, a child named Jesus, but referred to as HERO, is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City, teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes HERO is a threat, and the Chief of police Devlin (a derivative of the Devil or Satan), with the help of chief Rabbi Kai (Caiaphas), conspire to end HERO\'s revolutionary teachings.\n\nThe Opera is narrated by "Agent Hunter", a former I.C.O.N. agent who met HERO and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov (Peter), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), and Jude (Judas Iscariot) the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray HERO. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus\' miracles and sermons, using references from the Bible\'s four gospels, continues through Jesus\' execution, at the hands of I.C.O.N\'s angry mob, and eventually ending with his resurrection.\n\n\n', '!Oka Tokat\n\n!Oka Tokat is a Philippine paranormal drama which originally aired on ABS-CBN from June 24, 1997 to May 7, 2002 every Tuesday night. It starred Ricky Davao, Diether Ocampo, Jericho Rosales, Angelika Dela Cruz, Rica Peralejo, Paolo Contis and Agot Isidro. Its title is the reverse spelling of the phrase "Takot ako!" ("I\'m scared!"); hence, the exclamation point at the beginning. In 2001, the series was reformatted and it starred by the several child stars. It was the longest-running horror series on Philippine television.\n\nThe show revolves around a media crew led by Rona del Fierro (played by Isidro) who investigate paranormal cases with the help del Fierro\'s premonitions. Most of the story arcs feature creatures in Filipino mythology, including the "dwende" (dwarf), tikbalang, diwata and the engkanto.\n\nIt was re-aired on ABS-CBN\'s cable channel, Jeepney TV.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, ABS-CBN announced that !Oka Tokat will have its sequel entitled ""Oka2kat"".It was supposed to be aired in March 2011 but it was delayed to February 4, 2012. The sequel does not focus on the previous characters but has the same genre.\n\n\n', '!Women Art Revolution\n\n!Women Art Revolution is a 2010 documentary film directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson and distributed by Zeitgeist Films. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists, curators, critics, and historians.\n\n"!Women  Art Revolution" is a documentary film, created by Lynn Hershman begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests, it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s.\n\nLynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result. The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists; very few can name more than Frida Khalo. Hershman calls the film the, "remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told." She says the events of the day led her to feel an, "urgency to capture that moment" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera.\n\nThe film gets its name from Women Artists in Revolution (WAR), which formed in the 1960s as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time.\n\nThe film overlays historical events with feminist art events, which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the Vietnam War, Black Panthers, Civil Rights Movement, Women\'s Liberation, and Free Speech Movement. She labels the 1968 Miss America Pageant as the moment when art and politics fused, culminating in a weeklong protest of art events.\n\nThe film mentions that minimalism was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics, this movement didn\'t match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues, creating a platform for awareness of these events.\n\n\nThe film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category.\n\n"!Women Art Revolution" played at New York\'s IFC Center beginning June 1, 2011, before opening around the country.\n\nIn the film, Hershman states that the filming process, "has accumulated (roughly) 12,428 minutes of footage," and "!W.A.R." shows only 83 minutes, leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out. A digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson\'s interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the Stanford University Libraries collection, "!W.A.R. Voices of a Movement". According to the collection website, Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to "be shared with as wide an audience as possible."\n\nBarry Keith Grant praises the film in his "Film International" piece, "Leeson\'s film is a like a patchwork quilt of disparate footage, but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today."\n\nReviewer Ellen Druda says, "This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman\'s heart. Not only art lovers will come away with a deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way."\n\nRichard Knight for the "Windy City Times" has a more critical view of the film, explaining, "Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn\'t want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own - just like those \'womyn only\' coffeehouses that existed \'back in the day.\' So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries - and annoyingly overlooks the artists feminist forebears (like O\'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) - !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone."\n\nElisabeth Subrin states that, "Fusing history with memoir, Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion."\n\n', '$1 coin\n\n$1 coin may refer to:\n', '$1,000 genome\n\nThe $1,000 genome refers to an era of predictive and personalized medicine during which the cost of fully sequencing an individual\'s genome (WGS) is roughly one thousand USD. It is also the title of a book by British science writer and founding editor of Nature Genetics, Kevin Davies. By late 2015, the cost to generate a high-quality \'draft\' whole human genome sequence was just below $1,500.\n\nThe "$1,000 genome" catchphrase was first publicly recorded in December 2001 at a scientific retreat to discuss the future of biomedical research following publication of the first draft of the Human Genome Project (HGP), convened by the National Human Genome Research Institute at Airlie House in Virginia. The phrase neatly highlighted the chasm between the actual cost of the Human Genome Project, estimated at $2.7 billion over a decade, and the benchmark for routine, affordable personal genome sequencing.\n\nOn 2 October 2002, Craig Venter introduced the opening session of GSAC (The Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference) at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston: "The Future of Sequencing: Advancing Towards the $1,000 Genome." Speakers included George M. Church and executives from 454 Life Sciences, Solexa, U.S. Genomics, VisiGen and Amersham plc. In 2003, Venter announced that his foundation would earmark $500,000 for a breakthrough leading to the $1,000 genome. That sum was subsequently rolled into the Archon X Prize.\n\nIn October 2004, NHGRI introduced the first in a series of \'$1,000 Genome\' grants designed to advance "the development of breakthrough technologies that will enable a human-sized genome to be sequenced for $1,000 or less."\n\nIn a January 2006 article in "Scientific American" making the case for the Personal Genome Project, George M. Church wrote\n\nIn 2007, the journal "Nature Genetics" invited dozens of scientists to respond to its \'Question of the Year\':\n\nIn May 2007, during a ceremony held at Baylor College of Medicine, 454']
